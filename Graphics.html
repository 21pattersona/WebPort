<h1> Web Portfoloio: Graphics </h1>
<h2 id="evaluation"/> Evaluation of web graphics </h2>

<p> a.) Graphics are importent for a webpage. In this webpage color is all put together well and picture are placed perfectly. </p>
<p> The organization is very well placed and the style is good as well. This pictures are a little big but it is a clothing brand store so that is expected. The graphics deffently help the viewers with the content on the page. A very good sign no repetitive annoying colors are shown. All the information in there that is needed and easy to navagate. Also the text is easy to read and everything is well spaced. </p>

<h2 id="filetypes">Graphic File Types</h2>
<div> <p>I would say image 4 because, none of the other pictures really make sence. Image 1 is a graph but its out dated and has nothing to do with the site. Image 2 is a monkey, but unless your page is about monkeys it might through off your reader. Image 3 is somewhat a good image to use maybe for a background. Image 5 I would not use because it pops out alot and unless you want the reader want to stop I wouldnt use it.</div></p>
