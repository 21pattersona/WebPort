<h2>Accessibility Review of the Bordentown Home Page</h2>

<p>There are many accessibility tools to use for monline websites. The one I used was called WAVE. On that site you put the web page address and then tools show up on the page you put in. On the side it shows you the number of errors, alerts, features, structural elements and more. That is very usful and people who own web sites should use something like this.  </p>

<p>I studyied the bordentown middle school website. The audience for that website is students and parents. My partner had to look at yales art webpage. Fist had to find the site, then go to summer programs, and find summer courses. My partner could complete the task but it was very hard to find where everything was. It took maybe 5 minutes with 5steps in all. What I learned was that even important websites can be hard to navigate and people should really become more awear of how stable there pages are. The background was a distraction because they were bright colors and moving whcih made it harder to find what your looking for. What they should change is make the brackground more stable and make the information easier to find.</p>
